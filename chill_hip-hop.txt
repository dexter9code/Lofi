In 2017, a form of downtempo music tagged as "chillhop" or "lo-fi hip hop" became popular among YouTube music streamers. 
By 2018, several of these channels had millions of followers. One DJ, Ryan Celsius, theorized that they were inspired by a nostalgia for the commercial bumpers used by Toonami and Adult Swim in the 2000s, and that this "created a cross section of people that enjoyed both anime and wavy hip-hop beats".
These channels equally functioned as chatrooms, with participants often discussing their personal struggles.
By 2018, Spotify's "Chill Hits" playlist had 5.4 million listeners and had been growing rapidlymusic
